This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: stack overflow due to insufficient base cases. The `bug.hack` file contains a function that calculates the factorial of a number. However, it only handles the base case of 0, leading to infinite recursion for other numbers.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected version with proper base cases to prevent stack overflow errors.  This example highlights the importance of carefully defining base cases in recursive functions to avoid runtime errors.
